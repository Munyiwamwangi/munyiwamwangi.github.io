## How to quickly understand, and work with Markdown

1. I have received the challenge to build my website primarily using markdown from Tech Expert Academy.
2. So I followed the steps highlighted in the readme file.
3. Then I opened the docs or guide for learning and writing markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
4. It has been very interesting like understanding how to attach links like in point 3 above.
5. Then I followed the guide to write my content on my page.
6. I found it very satisfying, kuddos fellow Tech Experts.
7. Well, I might as well finish with the archives to practice a few more things.
